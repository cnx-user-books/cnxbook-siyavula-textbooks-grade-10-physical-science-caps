      <title>Introduction</title>
      <para id="id127925">Magnetism is a force that certain kinds of objects, which are called `magnetic' objects, can exert on each other without physically touching. A magnetic object is surrounded by a magnetic `field' that gets weaker as one moves further away from the object. A second object can feel a magnetic force from the first object because it feels the magnetic field of the first object.</para>
      <para id="id127932">Humans have known about magnetism for many thousands of years.
For example, <emphasis effect="italics">lodestone</emphasis> is a magnetised form of the iron oxide mineral
<emphasis effect="italics">magnetite</emphasis>. It has the property of attracting iron
objects. It is referred to in old European and Asian historical
records; from around 800 <emphasis effect="smallcaps">BCE</emphasis> in Europe and around
2Â 600 <emphasis effect="smallcaps">BCE</emphasis> in Asia.</para>

      <para id="id128302">The root of the English word <emphasis effect="italics">magnet</emphasis> is from the Greek word <emphasis effect="italics">magnes</emphasis>, probably from Magnesia in Asia Minor, once an important source of lodestone.</para>

      <title>Magnetic fields</title>
      <para id="id128332">A magnetic field is a region in space where a magnet or object made of magnetic material will experience a non-contact force.</para>
      <para id="id128337">Electrons inside any object have magnetic fields associated
with them. In most materials these fields point in all
directions, so the net magnetic field is zero. For example, in the plastic ball below,
the directions of the magnetic fields of the electrons (shown by the arrows) are pointing
in different directions and cancel each other out. Therefore the plastic ball is not magnetic and
has no magnetic field.</para>

      <para id="id128380">In permanent magnets, many domains are lined up, resulting in a <emphasis effect="italics">net magnetic field</emphasis>.
Objects made from ferromagnetic materials can be magnetised, for example by rubbing a magnet
along the object in one direction. This causes the magnetic fields of most, or all, of the domains to line up in one direction. As a result the object as a whole will have a net magnetic field. It is <emphasis effect="italics">magnetic</emphasis>. Once a ferromagnetic object has been magnetised, it can stay magnetic without another magnet being nearby (i.e. without being in another magnetic field). In the picture below, the needle has been magnetised because the magnetic fields in all the domains are pointing in the same direction.</para>

        <title>The earth's magnetic field</title>
        <para id="id128255">In the picture below, you can see a representation of the earth's magnetic
field which is very similar to the magnetic field of a giant bar magnet like
the one on the right of the picture. So the earth has two sets of north poles
and south poles: <emphasis effect="bold">geographic poles</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="bold">magnetic poles</emphasis>.</para>

        <para id="id129590">The earth's magnetic field is thought to be caused by flowing liquid metals
in the outer core which causes electric currents and a magnetic field. From the picture
you can see that the direction of magnetic north and true north are not
identical. The <emphasis effect="bold">geographic north pole</emphasis>, which is the point through which
the earth's rotation axis goes, is about 11,5<sup>o</sup> away from the direction of
the <emphasis effect="bold">magnetic north pole</emphasis> (which is where a compass will point). However,
the magnetic poles shift slightly all the time.</para>
        <para id="id129612">Another interesting thing to note is that if we think of the earth as a big
bar magnet, and we know that magnetic field lines always point
<emphasis effect="italics">from north to south</emphasis>, then the compass tells us that what we call the
<emphasis effect="italics">magnetic north pole</emphasis> is actually the <emphasis effect="italics">south pole</emphasis> of the bar magnet!</para>
<note id="notfhsst_id395"><title> Interesting Fact </title>
        <para id="id129640">The direction of the earth's magnetic field flips direction about once every
200Â 000 years! You can picture this as a bar magnet whose north and south pole
periodically switch sides. The reason for this is still not fully understood.</para>

<section id="fs-id7505799"><title>The importance of the magnetic field to life on Earth </title>
<para id="fs-id1166211137674">The earth's magnetic field is very important for humans and other animals on earth because it protects us from being bombarded (hit) by high energy charged particles which are emitted by the Sun. The stream of charged particles (mainly positively charged protons and negatively charged electrons) coming from the sun is called the solar wind. When these particles come close to the Earth, they become trapped by the Earth's magnetic field and cannot shower down to the surface where they can harm living organisms. 
Astronauts in space are at risk of being irradiated by the solar wind because they are outside the zones where the charged particles are trapped. 
</para> 
<para id="fs-id1166236522828">
The region above Earth's atmosphere in which charged particles are affected by Earth's magnetic field is called the magnetosphere. 
Relatively often, in addition to the usual solar wind, the Sun may eject a large bubble of material (protons and electrons) with its own magnetic field from its outer atmosphere. Sometimes these bubbles travel towards the Earth where their magnetic fields can join with Earth's magnetic field. When this happens a huge amount of energy is released into the Earth's magnetosphere, causing a geomagnetic storm. These storms cause rapid changes in the Earth's magnetosphere which in turn may affect electric and magnetic systems on the Earth such as power grids, cellphone networks, and other electronic systems.

 <title>Aurorae (pronounced Or-roar-ee) </title>
<para id="fs-id1166211416999">
Another effect caused by the Earth's magnetic field is the spectacular Northern and Southern Lights, which are also called the Aurora Borealis and the Aurora Australis respectively. When charged particles from the solar wind reach the Earth's magnetosphere, they spiral along the magnetic field lines towards the North and South poles. If they collide with particles in the Earth's atmosphere, they can cause red or green lights which stretch across a large part of the sky and which is called the aurora. Because this only happens close to the North and South poles, we cannot see the aurorae from South Africa. However, people living in the high Northern latitudes in Canada, Sweden, and Finland, for example, often see the Northern lights.
